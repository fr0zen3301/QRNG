# QRNG
Quantum Random Number Generator(QRNG) used to simulate quantum-based randomness. Unlike classical random number generators, which are algorithmically generated(thus deterministic), the QRNG uses the principles of quantum mechanics to generate truly random numbers. Quantum RNGs leverage phenomena like superposition or photon polarization to produce unpredictable and non-deterministic results.

# #V1.0 - Using software simulations of quantum states.

Since actual hardware is not accessible(rignt now), the first version simulates quantum states using random functions available in C itself. 

**#V1.0.1 - Added a feauture to save generated random numbers to a file for later use.**
