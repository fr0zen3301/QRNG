# QRNG
Quantum Random Number Generator(QRNG) used to simulate quantum-based randomness. Unlike classical random number generators, which are algorithmically generated(thus deterministic), the QRNG uses the principles of quantum mechanics to generate truly random numbers. Quantum RNGs leverage phenomena like superposition or photon polarization to produce unpredictable and non-deterministic results.
